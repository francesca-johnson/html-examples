              <h2>  Why I am in this "Web Design" class<h2>
              <p> I chose to take this class so as to gain and perfect my technology skills. The world of today and the world of tomorrow is based on technology. My ability to utilize and handle code, as well as technology, will dictate my future success.</p>

          <h2>  Having a Code Skill </h2>
          <p> Having skill while working with code will allow me to be better equipped to face the future. Technology advances are becoming more and more frequent. If I know how to use the technology and can read the code then I will be one step ahead of everyone else. I will be able to code my own websites and not have to pay someone to do it for me.</p>
          <p> As for currently, I can use my skills to code a family website or create a website for a school project and wow my teachers.</p>

            <h2>  Future Career Path.  </h2> 
            <p> I hope to pursue the medical fields and follow in my father's footsteps and become a Spine Pain Physician. </p>
            <p> My dream college is Stanford, but it is called a dream for a reason. After Stanford on the list is basically any UC college.</p>
