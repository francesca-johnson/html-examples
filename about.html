 	<h2>  Spine Pain Physician<h2>
         <p>My father is a Spine Pain Physician and he takes me to work sometimes. I love watching him work and the expressions on his patients faces. Everyone is so grateful to him for his help. I want to touch people the way he does.</p>

         <p> There are many prossiders he does to help people with their back pain. Injecting bone cement and  burning nerves are just a few examples.</p>
